Hi! My name is Yunzhuo Hao, a third-year undergraduate in Software Engineering at the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/). I’m a research intern at [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn), [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn), where I’m fortunate to work with Prof. [Yankai Lin](https://linyankai.github.io). My research interests mainly lie in Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically including the trustworthiness and security issues in large language models. I am also interested in other issues related to LLMs, such as LLM alignment, etc.
